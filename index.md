**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

I thought that the Expectation Maximization algorithm was very interesting. Refining the model based on the estimations of hidden paramters is powerful in the application of neural data. Especially when dealing with complex systems and unobserved variables.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

I'd like to see more about the interplay between brain regions in decision making. Specifically how the SciW and SCig interact and contribute to the decision-making process. I believe that by analyzing neural activity patterns and applying techniques like EM and potentially PCA, we can gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms and how these regions influence choices. 

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

In our Quarter 1 project, we used simulated data for the EM and GFPCA analysis. A significant improvement for the Quarter 2 project would be to utilize real neural recordings from mice.  It would also introduce the challenge of dealing with noise and variability inherent in real-world data.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

In addition to EM, I'd like to explore the use of PCA for latent variable analysis. PCA could help us reduce the dimensionality of the neural data and potentially reveal underlying patterns or relationships between the SciW and SCig that are not immediately apparent.
